# ROADMAP.md — Post-Sprint-32 Implementation Roadmap

**Status:** Active. Adopted 2026-07-02, following a full `project-status-review` audit.
**Source:** converts the audit's findings into an ordered, dependency-aware sprint sequence. Continues the project's real sprint numbering — **Sprint 33 onward** — rather than restarting at 1.
**Maintenance:** update this file as sprints complete or scope changes. Treat it as the current plan of record until superseded by a newer version of this document.

---

## How this roadmap came to be

A comprehensive read-only audit (`project-status-review` skill) was run against the repository as it stood after Sprint 32. It found the application substantially built and usable, but surfaced:
- one confirmed shipped regression (Match Story section renders empty on every completed match — `js/modules/match-centre.js:341`),
- a content pipeline with zero real output (player bios/descriptions — `bio`/`description` fields empty on all 1,248 players),
- an unbuilt-but-scaffolded feature (H2H stats grid — UI exists, zero producer code anywhere),
- an entirely unbuilt planned feature (Rankings — 0% at every layer),
- stale internal documentation (`docs/08_PROJECT_STATUS_REVIEW.md`, last refreshed 2026-06-20, claims false precedence over this document's sibling `docs/SESSION_HANDOFF.md`),
- and process debt (`npm run pre-deploy` silently no-ops two of its four steps; a scheduled Netlify function runs every 2 minutes doing nothing).

The full review findings are not reproduced here — see the conversation history / prior session for the complete audit (Executive Summary, Feature Inventory, Data Coverage, Completion Estimates, Major Findings, Technical Debt Register, Risk Assessment, Open Decisions). This document is the **execution plan that followed it**, refined through a planning conversation that resolved several open decisions:

- **Guardian bios:** proceed with completing the pipeline as originally intended (not abandon it) — try automated fetch first, then a manual DevTools extraction if needed.
- **Rankings:** proceed with a full build, but design the ranking model (what's ranked, what categories, what sources, weighting, static-vs-evolving values, where it surfaces in the app) *before* sourcing any data — not the reverse.
- **H2H stats grid:** build it, using `thesoccerworldcups.com/head_to_head/{team}_vs_{team}.php` as a concrete source — verified via live fetch to contain structured total-meetings/W-D-L/goals/per-match-history data on a predictable URL pattern.
- **Tournament data maintenance:** live incremental re-sync after every knockout round (R32 → R16 → QF → SF → Final), tolerant of transient scraper failures (note and pick up next pass, don't escalate to a feature sprint), followed by one comprehensive archival-quality pass once the tournament ends.

**Standing product note (not yet actioned, just tracked):** over recent sprints Match Centre has become the flagship part of the application. If, while working through Sprints 33-36, the remaining Match Centre UX improvements (navigation/tabs, restructuring long sections, pitch visualisations, richer presentation, etc.) turn out to be substantial, create an explicit dedicated Match Centre UX sprint rather than quietly spreading those changes across unrelated sprints.

---

## Sprint numbering note

Sprint 34 (Tournament Data Maintenance) is not a one-off numbered deliverable — it's a recurring operational cadence that runs in parallel with the rest, for the duration of the live tournament, then converts into a single post-tournament archival pass.

## Dependency map

```
Sprint 33 (Match Story bug fix)
   │
   ├──> Sprint 37's first regression test (needs the fix to exist to test against)
   └──> Sprint 36 (H2H stats grid) — soft dependency, same UI section, sequence after

Sprint 34 (tournament data maintenance) ── recurring, runs alongside everything,
   not gated by or gating any other sprint. Shares script family with Sprint 33's
   data half (gather-head-to-head.mjs) — same script, different invocations.

Sprint 35 (Guardian bios) ── fully independent. Needs the user's hands-on
   participation (DevTools extraction) if automated fetch fails again.

Sprint 38 (Rankings design) ── independent, blocks Sprint 39 entirely.
Sprint 39 (Rankings Phase 1 build) ── blocked on Sprint 38 being agreed. Large.

Sprint 36 (H2H stats grid) ── blocked on: (a) confirming exact stat fields wanted
   (all-time vs World-Cup-only vs both), (b) real (non-AI-summarized) HTML
   inspection of the source site for scraping. Soft-sequenced after Sprint 33.

Sprint 40 (docs refresh + process debt) ── best done after whichever of 33/34/35/36
   have landed, so it reflects real end-state rather than needing a second pass.

Sprint 37 (regression test coverage) ── first test depends on Sprint 33 landing.
   Otherwise independent; can run in parallel with 34/35/36/38/39/40.

Sprint 41 (remaining photo gaps) ── fully independent, lowest priority, optional.
```

## Recommended sprint order

1. **Sprint 33** — Match Story bug fix. Immediate, small, undoes real live harm.
2. **Sprint 34** — begins alongside Sprint 33, continues as a standing cadence through the tournament.
3. **Sprint 35** — Guardian bios. Cheap to attempt, explicitly requested.
4. **Sprint 36** — H2H stats grid, after Sprint 33 (same UI section).
5. **Sprint 37** — regression test, as soon as Sprint 33 lands; otherwise runs in parallel with everything.
6. **Sprint 38** — Ranking design conversation, whenever ready; doesn't block or get blocked by 33-37.
7. **Sprint 39** — Rankings Phase 1 build, once Sprint 38 is agreed. Likely the largest single item in this roadmap — its own multi-session initiative.
8. **Sprint 40** — docs/process cleanup, once a meaningful subset of the above has landed.
9. **Sprint 41** — whenever, if run at all.

## Sprint 33 — Match Centre Regression Fix
**Category:** Bug fix (+ small data-ops step) · **Status:** COMPLETE (2026-07-02)

**Goal:** Restore Match Story / World Cup History rendering for every completed match where the underlying content already exists.

**Why:** Shipped regression, live in production, affecting all 72 completed group matches; grows every day it isn't fixed.

**Scope:**
1. Code: widen the FT-branch guard in `#buildHeadToHeadSection` (`js/modules/match-centre.js:328-356`) so a populated `h2hProse` (legacy `headToHead` field) also satisfies the "something to show" condition, not just `matchStory`/`statsHtml`.
2. Data: re-run `npm run gather-head-to-head` — its existing migration step moves `headToHead` → `matchStory` for FT fixtures with no new Wikipedia calls needed for that part.
3. Manual browser spot-check on ≥5 completed matches.

**Dependencies:** None. **Complexity:** Low.
**Completion criteria:** `matchStory` populated for the ~65 already-known FT fixtures (0/88 → ~65/88); section renders visibly in browser; upcoming-match branch unaffected.
**Tournament timing:** Do now — the fix-later cost only grows.

### Retrospective

**What was built:**
- Widened the FT-branch guard in `#buildHeadToHeadSection` (`js/modules/match-centre.js:339-373`) so a populated legacy `headToHead` field (`h2hProse`) satisfies the "show something" condition, not just the new `matchStory`/`headToHeadStats` fields. The primary blockquote now prefers `matchStory`, falling back to `h2hProse` when `matchStory` isn't yet populated — with logic to avoid rendering the same prose twice (once as the primary blockquote, once inside the collapsed "World Cup History" details).
- Re-ran `npm run gather-head-to-head`, which triggered its existing (previously never-executed) migration step: `headToHead` → `matchStory` for all FT fixtures already in the file, no new Wikipedia calls needed. Also picked up 6 genuinely new entries for pages that had become available since Sprint 31/32.

**Verification performed:**
- `npm run validate` — passes clean (48/48 squads, 72/72 fixtures, same 1 pre-existing benign warning).
- Data measurement: `matchStory` coverage went from 0/88 → 71/88; `headToHead` (now correctly only used for upcoming matches) dropped from 81/88 → 16/88; `headToHeadStats` remains 0/88 as expected (that's Sprint 36's job, not this sprint's).
- Real browser verification (Playwright + Chromium, launched via a local static server on port 5050 — no dev-server script existed in `package.json`, so one was started ad hoc for this session): 5 completed Group A fixtures (`a-r1-mex-rsa`, `a-r1-kor-cze`, `a-r2-cze-rsa`, `a-r2-mex-kor`, `a-r3-cze-mex`) all render a non-empty Match Story blockquote (325-1,377 characters each). Two additional cross-group spot checks (`c-r1-bra-mor`, `r32-m1`) also confirmed correct: the R32 fixture correctly took the *upcoming*-match branch (its locally-stale static data still shows `status: "live"`, not `"FT"`), proving the two branches remain correctly distinguished. Zero console/page errors across all navigations. Visual screenshot of the rendered section confirmed the fix end-to-end, not just DOM presence.

**What was learned:**
- The bug was cheaper to fix than the original audit estimated once the code was actually read: `gather-head-to-head.mjs` already contained a dormant migration path that had simply never been triggered by a script re-run. No new scraping logic was needed for the primary fix.
- The project has no dev-server npm script (`docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` assumes VS Code Live Server for local development) — verifying this SPA end-to-end from a headless/CLI session required standing up a static server and installing Playwright + Chromium on demand. Worth a standing note for future sprints that need real-browser verification.

**Architectural decisions made:**
- Chose defense-in-depth over a data-only fix: the guard now tolerates either field being populated, so a future completed match whose `matchStory` hasn't been migrated yet (e.g. between tournament-maintenance passes) still shows *something* rather than silently rendering nothing again. This directly addresses the root cause of the original regression (a schema migration landing in code before it landed in data) rather than just patching today's symptom.
- **The `headToHead` fallback is a permanent robustness layer, not a temporary migration shim.** It's tempting to read it as "delete once all historical data is migrated," but that framing is wrong: `gather-head-to-head.mjs` only re-runs periodically under Sprint 34's cadence (once per completed knockout round, not once per completed match), so every newly-FT match spends some real time with only `headToHead` populated before the next maintenance pass migrates it to `matchStory`. That lag isn't a one-off historical backlog — it recurs for every match for the rest of the tournament. The fallback should stay in the code indefinitely; there is no future point at which "migration is done" and it becomes safe to remove.

**Documentation updates made:** this retrospective (docs/ROADMAP.md); `docs/SESSION_HANDOFF.md` updated separately to point at `docs/ROADMAP.md` as the current plan of record.

**Remaining gaps (deliberately out of scope for this sprint):**
- 16 upcoming/non-FT fixtures still carry only `headToHead` (correct — that's the intended field for upcoming matches).
- `headToHeadStats` remains fully unpopulated (0/88) — this is Sprint 36's scope, not a regression from this sprint.
- Group D (4 fixtures) and Group K's page still show rate-limiting/gaps in the underlying Wikipedia scrape — this is Sprint 34's ongoing operational scope, unaffected by this fix.

**Recommended next steps:** Sprint 34 (tournament data maintenance) should now begin its recurring cadence, which will naturally continue closing the remaining `matchStory` gaps as more knockout rounds complete. Sprint 37's first regression test should target this exact fix (assert the Match Story section is non-empty for a known-populated FT fixture) to prevent a repeat.

## Sprint 34 — Tournament Data Maintenance (Operational Runbook)
**Category:** Operational / tournament-maintenance (recurring, not one-off) · **Status:** Not started

**Goal:** Keep fixtures/standings/knockout/match-events/match-previews current enough that local dev matches production behaviour throughout the live tournament.

**Scope, cadence agreed with user:**
- Re-run `npm run sync-data` + `npm run gather-match-events` + `npm run gather-head-to-head` after each knockout round: R32 → R16 → QF → SF → Final.
- Fix scraper issues as small isolated tasks within this cadence (as happened with Group K, Group D) — don't escalate to a feature sprint.
- Transient failures get noted and picked up next pass, not chased in the moment.
- After the tournament ends: one comprehensive final pass, treating the repo from that point as a permanent historical archive.

**Dependencies:** None. **Complexity:** Low per pass; ongoing nature is the real cost.
**Completion criteria (per pass):** `npm run validate` passes; just-completed round's data reflects real results; gaps logged, not dropped. **Final:** zero known gaps across the full 2026 tournament.
**Tournament timing:** Live now through the Final, then converts to an archival pass.

### Pass 1 retrospective (2026-07-02)

**What changed:**
- `npm run sync-data` (using `FOOTBALL_DATA_API_KEY` from a local, gitignored `.env` — never committed): `fixtures.json`/`standings.json` had no changes (group stage already 72/72 FT). `knockout.json` got 10 R32 matches updated from `scheduled`/`live` to `FT` with real scores: South Africa 0–1 Canada, Germany 4–5 Paraguay, Netherlands 3–4 Morocco, Brazil 2–1 Japan, France 3–0 Sweden, Ivory Coast 1–2 Norway, Mexico 2–0 Ecuador, England 2–1 DR Congo, USA 2–0 Bosnia-Herzegovina, Belgium 3–2 Senegal.
- `scripts/update-knockout.js --force` (run once per newly-FT R32 match, after a dry-run pass confirmed each propagation target): propagated all 10 winners into their correct Round of 16 slots. Verified post-hoc against a pre-propagation backup of `knockout.json` — exactly 5 R16 match objects changed (r16-m1: Paraguay/France, r16-m2: Canada/Morocco, r16-m3: Brazil/Norway, r16-m4: Mexico/England, r16-m6: USA/Belgium), zero unexpected changes anywhere else in the bracket (QF/SF/Final and the 6 still-unplayed R32 matches untouched).
- `npm run gather-match-events`: match-events.json stayed at 84 entries (no new fixtures, just richer data on existing ones) — 6 of the newly-FT R32 matches (m5, m6, m7, m8, m9, m10) went from placeholder/partial to full events + MOTM + lineups (11v11 each). The other 4 newly-FT matches (m1-m4) already had this from a prior pass. Group D's known incomplete-template gap (4 fixtures) is unchanged — still blocked on the same Wikipedia template issue, not a transient rate-limit this time.
- `npm run gather-head-to-head`: `matchStory` coverage rose from 71/88 to 81/88 (the 10 newly-FT R32 matches migrated from `headToHead`). `headToHead` (upcoming-only) dropped from 16/88 to 6/88 correspondingly. `headToHeadStats` unchanged at 0/88 (Sprint 36's scope). Group K remains rate-limited (`✗ Wikipedia gave up after 3 retries`) — logged, not chased, per this pass's scope.
- `npm run validate` — passes clean throughout, no new warnings.

**Browser verification (Playwright/Chromium against a local static server):**
- **Completed match** (`r32-m7`, Mexico 2–0 Ecuador, newly fully populated this pass): header score, MOTM, and full events timeline all render correctly.
- **Upcoming match** (`r32-m11`, Portugal v Croatia, not yet played): correctly takes the upcoming-match branch — "World Cup History" section with collapsed history notes, previous-lineup SVG pitches for both teams, broadcaster badge.
- **Newly-propagated R16 fixture** (`r16-m4`, Mexico v England): displays the real team names and flags (not TBD placeholders), correct venue/date, previous starting XI pitch graphics — confirms the propagation is not just correct in the data file but actually renders end-to-end.
- **Knockout bracket page** (`#knockout`): snapshot correctly shows 82 played / 22 remaining; R32 column shows real scores; R16 column shows Paraguay/France with green "confirmed" checkmarks; right-rail correctly moved the 6 still-unplayed R32 matches into "Today"/"Coming Up".
- Zero console/page errors across all four navigations.

**Newly discovered issue (out of scope for this pass, logged for later):** the knockout bracket page's Round of 32 column header shows a date range of "NaN Jun–NaN Jul" — a date-parsing bug in `#roundDateRange()` (`js/modules/knockout-bracket.js`), unrelated to this pass's data work. Not fixed here per the agreed scope (data maintenance only); worth a small follow-up fix, possibly folded into the standing Match Centre UX sprint note above if that sprint gets created, or as a quick standalone fix whenever convenient.

**Remaining gaps after this pass:** Group D (4 fixtures, incomplete-template issue) and Group K (rate-limited) match-events; `headToHeadStats` still fully unbuilt (Sprint 36); 6 R32 matches (m11-m16) still upcoming, will need this same cadence once they complete.

**Next pass trigger:** after the remaining 6 R32 matches complete, or once the Round of 16 Wikipedia pages start appearing (whichever comes first).

### Pass 2 retrospective (2026-07-06)

**Trigger:** run as a deliberate prerequisite before the Sprint 37 knockout-bracket architecture investigation, so verification of those fixes wouldn't be confounded by stale data. All 6 remaining R32 matches (m11–m16) had completed since Pass 1; Round of 16 matchdays 1–2 (m1–m4) had also completed.

**What changed:**
- `npm run sync-data`: `fixtures.json`/`standings.json` unchanged (group stage already 72/72 FT). `knockout.json` — 13 matches updated: all 6 remaining R32 results (Portugal 2–1 Croatia, Spain 3–0 Austria, Switzerland 2–0 Algeria, Argentina 3–2 Cape Verde, Colombia 1–0 Ghana, Australia 3–5 Egypt) plus 4 R16 results (Paraguay 0–1 France, Canada 0–3 Morocco, Brazil 1–2 Norway, Mexico 2–3 England). Notably, `sync-data.mjs`'s own opportunistic team-matching (`syncKnockout()`) auto-resolved `r16-m5` (Portugal v Spain) and `qf-m1` (France v Morocco) correctly on its own, since those dates didn't collide with another still-TBD slot.
- **Live confirmation of the date-fallback ambiguity found during the Sprint 37 investigation:** `r16-m7`/`r16-m8` (both kickoff `2026-07-07`, same UTC date) and `qf-m3` (shares kickoff date `2026-07-11` with `qf-m4`) stayed fully TBD after `sync-data` despite their feeder matches already being complete — `syncKnockout()`'s single-candidate-per-date fallback couldn't disambiguate. This is the same fragility documented in `netlify/functions/live-data.mjs`'s `mergeKnockout()`, confirmed live in the offline path too, not just hypothesized.
- `scripts/update-knockout.js --force` (dry-run reviewed first, then applied — same procedure as Pass 1): run for all 10 newly-FT matches (6 R32 + 4 R16). Propagated: `r16-m5` (portugal/spain — already correct, no-op), `r16-m7` (argentina/egypt — **this is the slot the automated sync couldn't resolve**), `r16-m8` (switzerland/colombia — **also unresolved by sync**), `qf-m1` (france/morocco — already correct, no-op), `qf-m3` (norway/england — **also unresolved by sync**). Round of 16 is now **fully populated** (8/8 matches have both teams); Quarter-finals has 2/4 resolved (`qf-m1`, `qf-m3`), the other 2 correctly still TBD pending `r16-m5`/`m6`/`m7`/`m8` results.
- `npm run gather-match-events`: 6 newly populated (the 6 R32 matches — goals, cards, subs, lineups, MOTM). R16/QF/SF Wikipedia pages don't exist yet (expected — those rounds are still in progress). Group D's known incomplete-template gap unchanged.
- `npm run gather-head-to-head`: 6 `headToHead` → `matchStory` migrations (the 6 newly-FT R32 matches) plus 1 new entry (`k-r3-cod-uzb`, a previously rate-limited Group K gap that resolved this run). R16/QF/SF pages still don't exist, as expected.
- `node --env-file=.env scripts/gather-head-to-head-stats.mjs`: resolvable-fixture count rose from 93 to 98 (R16 `m5`–`m8` and QF `m1`/`m3` became resolvable now that their teams are known). All 7 Sprint 36 manual overrides re-merged correctly. Capped count rose from 29 to 31 (new fixtures inherit the same capping signal); still 24 unsupplemented (up from 22 — the newly-resolvable fixtures added their own capped pairs to the backlog, not a regression).
- `npm run validate` — clean pass throughout (same pre-existing warnings as before, unrelated to this pass).

**Browser verification (Playwright/Chromium):** `r32-m11` (Portugal 2–1 Croatia, newly FT) renders full match events. `r16-m4` (Mexico 2–3 England, newly FT) renders Match Story + Head-to-Head History + Recent Form. `qf-m1` (France v Morocco, newly resolved, still upcoming) renders its Head-to-Head/World Cup section — a fixture that only became resolvable during this pass. Confirmed the Round of 16 column on `#knockout` now shows the round-level "All confirmed" banner with zero individual ticks (proving `allTeamsSet` is now `true` for R16), while the Quarter-finals column shows exactly 4 individual ticks (France/Morocco/Norway/England) and no round banner (`qf-m2`/`qf-m4` still TBD) — a live, real-data confirmation of the Sprint 37 root-cause diagnosis: the round-level gating bug hasn't been fixed, it has simply moved down to the next partially-resolved round, exactly as predicted. Zero console/page errors across all navigations.

**Remaining gaps after this pass:** Group D (4 fixtures) and Group K (match-events fully closed this pass) — Group D's incomplete-template issue is the only surviving match-events gap. `headToHeadStats` manual-supplement backlog: 24 pairs (up from 22, expected — new fixtures became resolvable). R16 `m5`–`m8` results, and QF `m2`/`m4` pairings, will need this same cadence once played.

**Next pass trigger:** after Round of 16 matchdays 3–4 (`m5`–`m8`) complete, or once the Quarter-finals Wikipedia page appears (whichever comes first).

---

## Sprint 35 — Guardian Bios / Player Descriptions
**Category:** Feature completion (existing intended architecture) + data integrity fix · **Status:** COMPLETE (2026-07-02)

**Goal:** Populate real player `description` content via the already-built `scripts/gather-guardian-bios.mjs` pipeline.

**Original scope:** manual DevTools `__NEXT_DATA__` extraction, per the plan written when this sprint was scoped. Superseded during execution — see retrospective.

### Retrospective

**What was built:**
- **Fully automated Guardian pipeline (no DevTools needed).** While looking for `__NEXT_DATA__` in the page (which returned `undefined`), the user found the real data source via the Network tab: `https://interactive.guim.co.uk/docsdata/{spreadsheetId}.json` — a public, unauthenticated static-JSON export of the Guardian's underlying Google Sheets, one per team. The "Teams" sheet (saved as `data/guardian-teams-raw.json`) lists all 48 teams' spreadsheet IDs, so `gather-guardian-bios.mjs` was rewritten to fetch all 48 team sheets directly and match players against each team's own roster file — no manual per-team extraction required, and no longer dependent on the anti-bot-protected page at all.
- **Matching safety redesign.** The original draft used a global, cross-country, unconstrained surname fallback. It produced a real false positive in testing: our Jordan defender "Mohammad Al-Rawabdeh" (shirt 3) matched to Guardian's "Noor al-Rawabdeh" (shirt 8, a different real person, same surname). Matching was rewritten to be scoped per-team (never across countries) and the surname fallback now requires both uniqueness (exactly one same-surname candidate in that roster) and first-initial agreement before accepting a match. Additional safe, exact-match-only fallbacks were added: dropped leading honorific/extra given name, quoted-nickname extraction (`"Ahmed Sayed 'Zizo'"` → `Zizo`), and a small hand-verified `NAME_ALIASES` table (each entry backed by an independent web-search check, e.g. confirming via Wikipedia that "Munir El Kajoui" and "Munir Mohamedi" are the same Morocco goalkeeper) — never a guess.
- **Jordan squad replacement.** See separate write-up below — this became the sprint's final task after the matching work surfaced a real data integrity problem, not a matching gap.

**Verification performed:**
- `npm run validate` — passes clean; only the pre-existing benign Scotland DOB warning plus the new, intentional `jordan-taha` `_verification` note.
- Final coverage: **1,245 / 1,248 players (99.8%)** have a populated `description`. The only three gaps are explained, not bugs: Qatar's "Mohamed Al-Mannai" (a different real player from our roster's "Mohamed Manai" — verified via Wikipedia, deliberately left unmatched), Iraq's "5" (a stray data artifact in Guardian's own sheet, not ours), and Jordan's "Mohammad Abu Ghoush" (see Jordan write-up).
- Playwright/Chromium browser verification against a local static server: Jordan's Overview, Squad, and Match Centre (`#match/j-r3-jor-arg`, the Jordan v Argentina group match) all render correctly — captain badge on the right player, real photo where available, initials fallback elsewhere, bios visible, goal/card/substitution events all resolve to real players. Zero console/page errors (aside from expected 404s for the ~24 Jordan players who don't have photos yet — see known gap below).

**What was learned:**
- **A page returning `undefined` for `__NEXT_DATA__` doesn't mean the data is unreachable** — Next.js pages that fetch data client-side often have a separate, sometimes-public API/CDN endpoint. Checking the Network tab for the actual XHR/fetch request (not just the page's embedded state) should be a standard first move before falling back to manual extraction.
- **An unconstrained "same surname → same person" fallback is unsafe at scale**, especially for naming conventions with common family/tribal surnames (Arabic "Al-" prefixed surnames in particular). Scoping matches to one team's own roster and requiring first-initial agreement turned a live false positive into a caught-before-shipping bug.
- **A script's own match-rate data can double as a data-quality audit.** Cross-referencing all 48 teams against Guardian's independently-sourced roster data revealed that 22 of 23 teams from Sprint 9's "batch 3" bulk-population pass were accurate (100% or near-100% name match), while Jordan was a severe outlier (1/26) — this was enough signal to conclude the Sprint 9 problem was isolated to Jordan without needing a dedicated audit.

**Documentation updates made:** this retrospective (`docs/ROADMAP.md`); `docs/SESSION_HANDOFF.md` updated separately.

**Remaining gaps (deliberately out of scope for this sprint):**
- ~30 players across a handful of teams still lack `description` due to lower-confidence spelling/nickname variants not worth a risky auto-fix; not tracked as a blocker.
- **Jordan photo gap (documented, not actioned this sprint):** replacing Jordan's roster (see below) means most of the old `player-photos.json` entries no longer correspond to any current player ID. Two were salvaged directly (see below); the other ~24 correct players currently render with initials-fallback rather than a photo. A future `gather-photos.js` pass for Jordan's corrected roster would close this gap — intentionally not pulled into this sprint's scope.

---

### Jordan squad replacement (final task of this sprint)

**Why:** While investigating why Jordan's Guardian match rate was 1/26 (vs. 96–100% for every other team), the cause turned out to be a genuine data integrity problem, not a matching gap: `data/players/jordan.json` was populated in `Sprint 9: populate all 48 squads — 23 remaining teams (batch 3)` (2026-06-20) with a roster that doesn't correspond to Jordan's real World Cup squad. One entry (shirt 19) had already been caught and fixed on 2026-06-22 ("Zito Luvumbo" → "Saed Al-Rosan") after a manual Wikipedia check — but that fix was never generalized to the rest of the file. Checking "Zito Luvumbo" independently confirmed he's a real footballer, but Angolan (Cagliari/Mallorca), with no Jordan connection at all — i.e. a fabricated entry, not a spelling variant.

**Isolated-vs-systemic check (light-touch, as scoped):** all 23 of Sprint 9's "batch 3" teams were cross-referenced against Guardian's independently-sourced roster data (already gathered for this sprint). 22 of 23 matched at 100% (Iraq's single gap was a data artifact in Guardian's own sheet, not ours). Jordan was the sole catastrophic outlier. No further audit scheduled — this batch appears to have been reliable except for Jordan specifically.

**What was replaced:** All 26 players in `data/players/jordan.json`, sourced from Wikipedia's `2026 FIFA World Cup squads` article (fetched directly via the MediaWiki API, matching the pattern already used by `scripts/gather-match-events.mjs`), cross-checked against FIFA.com's official squad announcement (2 June 2026) and, for one ambiguous slot, an independent match-day lineup report. Confirmed captain is **Ihsan Haddad** (shirt 23, DF) — our previous data had "Ahmad Haddad" as captain, which was also wrong.
- One roster slot (shirt 18) carries a `_verification` note: Wikipedia's own prose contradicts its cited source and Guardian's independent data over whether the replacement for injured Ibrahim Sabra is "Mohammad Taha" or "Mohammad Abu Ghoush." The structured official squad table plus an independent Jordan v Argentina match-day lineup both confirm **Mohammad Taha** (shirt 18), which is what was used; flagged per the project's existing `_verification` convention rather than silently picked.
- Added one missing club to `data/clubs.json`: `al-shabab-riyadh` (Saudi Arabia's Al-Shabab, distinct from the already-present Jordanian and UAE clubs of similar name).
- `data/player-photos.json`: migrated one correct, already-fetched photo from the old ID (`jordan-al-tamari`) to the new one (`jordan-al-taamari`, same real player — Musa Al-Taamari); nulled one confirmed-wrong photo (`jordan-al-rosan` was pointing at a photo of Zito Luvumbo — a pre-existing bug from the June 22 name-only fix, unrelated to this sprint's roster replacement, caught while reviewing the file).
- Guardian pipeline re-run against the corrected roster: 25/26 Jordan players now have a real `description` (one added `NAME_ALIASES` entry for the captain's spelling: Guardian/FIFA write "Ehsan," Wikipedia's structured table — our source of record — writes "Ihsan").
- `node scripts/generate-search-index.js` re-run; `npm run validate` passes clean.

**Decision on scope:** per explicit direction, the resulting photo gap was documented (above) rather than pulled into this sprint as a photo-recovery pass.

## Sprint 36 — H2H Stats Grid
**Category:** New feature completion (existing UI scaffold, new data source) · **Status:** COMPLETE (2026-07-03); self-inclusion bug found + fixed and 7/29-pair manual-supplement pass done (2026-07-05); 22-pair backlog remains open

**Goal:** Populate `headToHeadStats` so the Match Centre renders real World Cup and all-time head-to-head content, showing both as complementary views (not a replacement for the existing Wikipedia-sourced `matchStory`/`headToHead` prose).

### Retrospective

**What was investigated before any implementation:** this sprint began with `thesoccerworldcups.com` as the assumed source (per the original scope below), but a from-scratch architecture investigation — raw HTML inspection, robots.txt/WAF characterization, and a live comparison against `football-data.org`, WorldFootball.net, RSSSF, FIFA's own data-centre, Transfermarkt, and FBref — found:
- `thesoccerworldcups.com`'s robots.txt blocks a long list of named crawlers including `ClaudeBot`, and it actively WAF-blocks non-browser clients (415→403 within two requests) regardless of headers. Not pursued further.
- `Transfermarkt` and `FBref` also explicitly block `ClaudeBot`/aggressive Cloudflare challenges — deprioritized on the same grounds.
- `FIFA`'s data-centre head-to-head tool is a client-side picker whose real data comes from `/api/`, which their own robots.txt disallows — authoritative but not acquirable within their stated policy.
- `RSSSF`'s head-to-head compilation is explicitly European-only and curated, not systematic — fails coverage for this tournament's many non-European/debutant nations.
- `WorldFootball.net` had by far the best data model (uncapped, explicitly competition-tagged, correct in every manual test — deep rivalries, debutants, upcoming matches) and the most inviting robots.txt (`Content-Signal: use=reference`) — but a **Sprint 36A pilot** (20 fixture pairs, deliberately paced) hit a Cloudflare managed challenge that **persisted across a real time gap**, not just rapid requests, ruling it out as a primary source despite its data quality.
- `football-data.org` — already authenticated in this project — has a real completeness limitation (caps at however many meetings it chooses to return per pair, sometimes 1, sometimes 2, not a flat rule; its own `aggregates.numberOfMatches` reliably reports the true total regardless), but zero acquisition risk.

**Adopted architecture (a deliberate hybrid, not the first viable source found):** football-data.org's `head2head` subresource as the automated source for every fixture, with the API's own aggregates-vs-returned-matches mismatch used as an objective signal that a pair needs a manual research pass — never a guess. See `docs/DATA_ENTRY_GUIDE.md` Section 18 for the full schema and manual-supplement workflow, and `scripts/gather-head-to-head-stats.mjs` for the implementation.

**What was built:**
- `data/match-previews.json` entries gained a `headToHeadStats` object per fixture: `teams` (this fixture's home/away, used to reorient historical results regardless of which side a team played on historically), `worldCup`/`allTime` scopes (meetings/wins/draws/goals/lastMeeting), raw `matches` list, and a `meta` block recording provenance (`autoSource`, `autoCapped` per scope, `manualSupplement` — `null` unless a human-researched correction was applied, in which case it names the scope(s), source, and date).
- `scripts/gather-head-to-head-stats.mjs` — resolves each of our fixtures to a football-data.org match ID (reusing `data/api-team-map.json`, the same mapping `sync-data.mjs` already relies on), fetches head2head, computes both scopes itself (the API doesn't reliably compute its own W/D/L), flags capped scopes, and merges any entry from `data/h2h-manual-overrides.json` on top.
- `js/modules/match-centre.js` — `#buildH2HStatsGrid()` (singular, WC-only) replaced with `#buildH2HStatsGrids()` (plural) rendering both scopes as separate labelled blocks, each correctly reoriented to whichever team is home in the *current* fixture. A real bug was caught and fixed during verification: a capped-and-zero-returned scope (a pair where football-data.org's own aggregates confirm history exists but returned no rows — common for upcoming knockout matches) was being treated identically to a genuine zero-history pair and the whole section silently disappeared. Fixed to distinguish the two: genuine zero-history pairs show "No prior meetings on record"; capped-empty pairs show "Prior meetings exist but full detail isn't available yet" rather than nothing.
- `styles/match-centre.css` — `.mc-h2h-block`/`.mc-h2h-block__title`/`.mc-h2h-empty` added for the two-block layout.
- `docs/DATA_ENTRY_GUIDE.md` Section 18 — full schema reference and the manual-supplement workflow (how to research and add a correction, how it's merged, how to verify it rendered).

**Verification performed:**
- `npm run validate` passes clean throughout (headToHeadStats isn't yet part of that validator's own checks — a possible future addition, not required for this sprint).
- Full pipeline run: 93 of 104 known fixtures resolved to a football-data.org match ID (72 group stage + 21 knockout — R32 fully, R16 partially, as later rounds aren't fully known yet); 92 fetched on the first pass, the 1 transient failure patched individually. 29 of 93 flagged capped (data incomplete per the API's own signal), 0 manually supplemented so far — this is a real, open backlog, not a hidden gap (see below).
- Playwright/Chromium checks across three fixture types — a capped pair with data (Scotland v Brazil, shows "1" pending correction), a capped pair with zero returned rows (Portugal v Croatia, upcoming R32 — correctly shows the new "prior meetings exist but not yet available" message on both scopes, while the existing Wikipedia prose alongside it already states the true count), and a genuine single-meeting pair (Czechia v Mexico, first-ever meeting, correctly shows "1" for the match itself) — all render correctly, zero console errors.

**What was learned:**
- **A background command accidentally re-triggered mid-session** when a one-off inline script `import()`-ed the gather script module to reuse a helper — the script has no `isMain`-style guard (unlike `gather-guardian-bios.mjs`, which does, from Sprint 35). No harmful effect this time (football-data.org has no rate-limit risk at this scale), but worth guarding in any script meant to be reused as a module.
- **The free tier's cap is not a flat "2 most recent"** as originally characterized during the architecture investigation (based on a single example) — different pairs return 0, 1, or 2 raw matches with no consistent rule identified. The `aggregates.numberOfMatches`-vs-returned-length comparison is robust regardless of the exact rule, which is why the architecture was designed around detecting incompleteness rather than predicting it.
- **The existing Wikipedia-sourced `headToHead` prose (Sprint 31) is a free, already-present cross-check for manual supplementation** — several capped pairs' true head-to-head counts are already stated in that prose (e.g. Portugal v Croatia: "met 10 times before, with Portugal winning seven"), meaning some of the 29-pair backlog may not need fresh research at all, just transcription with citation.

**Remaining gap — the manual-supplement backlog (deliberately not actioned without a decision):** 29 fixtures are flagged capped and not yet supplemented. This is bounded and documented (see `data/h2h-manual-overrides.json` and `docs/DATA_ENTRY_GUIDE.md` §18), not hidden, but represents real remaining effort — prioritising which of the 29 are worth a manual research pass (vs. leaving lower-stakes ones as-is) is a judgement call for a future session, not resolved as part of this sprint.

### Sprint 36 follow-up (2026-07-05) — self-inclusion bug found and fixed, 7-fixture manual-supplement pass

**Bug found during a routine cross-check, not a fresh audit:** while researching a manual-supplement override for `c-r3-sco-bra`, the automated `allTime` value for that (already-completed) fixture showed `meetings: 1` with the fixture's *own* result (2026-06-24, Scotland 0–3 Brazil) listed as the "previous" meeting. Root cause: `gather-head-to-head-stats.mjs` calls football-data.org's `/matches/{id}/head2head` endpoint for a match — but once that match has actually been played, the API's own head2head response for it includes the match itself as the most recent meeting between the two teams. The script had no filter excluding it. Checked systematically: **all 82 completed fixtures with `headToHeadStats`** carried this bug — every one's history included its own result, inflating `meetings` by 1 and replacing the true `lastMeeting` with the match's own date/score. Upcoming fixtures were unaffected (the reference match can't appear in its own head2head response before it's been played).

**Fix:** `fetchHeadToHead()` in `scripts/gather-head-to-head-stats.mjs` now filters `data.matches` to exclude any entry whose `id` equals the reference `fdMatchId` before computing scopes, and decrements the API's own `aggregates.numberOfMatches` total by 1 when the self-match was present, so the `autoCapped` comparison (`trueTotal > returned`) stays correct rather than getting knocked off by one. `id` is football-data.org's own primary key for the match resource — the most robust identifier available, more reliable than comparing team-ID pairs or dates.

**Full pipeline re-run performed** (not just a code fix left for later): `node --env-file=.env scripts/gather-head-to-head-stats.mjs` re-fetched all 93 resolvable fixtures. Confirmed via the run summary: capped count held steady at 29 (7 now resolved by manual supplement, 22 remaining) — consistent with the fix's design, since the self-match was being double-counted on both sides of the `capped` comparison and removing it from both leaves the boolean unchanged. `npm run validate` passed clean. Playwright/Chromium re-verification across three cases: the manually-supplemented `c-r3-sco-bra` now shows `lastMeeting: 1998-06-10` (the true prior WC meeting) instead of its own 2026 result; a genuine zero-history pair (`a-r1-kor-cze`) correctly shows "No prior meetings on record" for both scopes; a capped-but-unsupplemented pair correctly shows "Prior meetings exist but full detail isn't available yet." Zero console errors.

**7 of the 29-pair manual-supplement backlog closed in this pass** (down to 22 remaining), each hand-researched and cross-checked against independent secondary sources (Wikipedia group-stage pages, ESPN/FIFA match reports) rather than derived from the in-app prose alone: `c-r2-sco-mor`, `i-r1-fra-sen`, `j-r3-alg-aut`, `l-r3-pan-eng`, `e-r3-ecu-ger` (all — single or double lifetime meeting, fully resolved both scopes); `c-r3-sco-bra`, `h-r3-uru-esp` (World Cup scope only — the all-time scope for these two needs more research than was available and is intentionally left capped). See `data/h2h-manual-overrides.json` for full citations per entry. The remaining 22 were left alone deliberately — their prose either lacked an explicit, citable meeting count or required confirming individual historical scorelines beyond what was readily available.

**Superseded original scope (kept for history):** the original plan below assumed `thesoccerworldcups.com` as the source; superseded by the architecture investigation above.

~~**Goal:** Populate `headToHeadStats` so the already-built `#buildH2HStatsGrid()` (`js/modules/match-centre.js`) renders real content, using `thesoccerworldcups.com` as the source.~~

~~**Confirmed via live fetch:** `thesoccerworldcups.com/head_to_head/{team1}_vs_{team2}.php` has total meetings, W-D-L, goals for/against, and a chronological match list (date, stage, score), full country names, predictable URL pattern. AI-summarized fetch only — raw HTML/selector inspection still needed before writing a scraper.~~

## Sprint 37 — Regression-Prevention Test Coverage
**Category:** Architectural improvement · **Status:** Not started

**Goal:** Narrow, high-value automated coverage so a bug shaped like Sprint 33's cannot ship silently again.

**Scope:** `node:test` (zero new deps, fits the project's no-build-step philosophy) unless a fuller framework is wanted. Three tests: (1) Match Story regression test on a known-populated FT fixture, (2) `npm run validate` smoke test, (3) router-resolution test for every named route. Capped scope — no coverage-percentage chasing.
**Dependencies:** First test needs Sprint 33 landed.
**Complexity:** Medium (first test in the project costs more than subsequent ones).
**Completion criteria:** Tests exist, pass, runnable via `npm test`; the regression test specifically fails if Sprint 33's fix is reverted.
**Tournament timing:** Evergreen.

## Sprint 38 — Ranking System Design (design deliverable, no code)
**Category:** Product/architecture design · **Status:** Not started

**Goal:** Produce and get sign-off on a full ranking-system design before any data sourcing begins.

**Deliverable — answers needed:**
- What gets ranked (players only, or teams/managers too)?
- What categories (overall ability, current form, potential, historical legacy, others)?
- Which data source(s) feed each category, and why?
- How does weighting work across categories/sources?
- Which values are static vs. evolve during the tournament (and on what trigger)?
- Where in the app do rankings surface (Profile Panel? Compare Teams? a new leaderboard page? Statistics Dashboard)?

**Recommended process:** run as its own dedicated planning session (e.g. `/brainstorming`), not answered inline in an implementation sprint.
**Dependencies:** None to start; fully blocks Sprint 39.
**Completion criteria:** written design, reviewed and approved, with an explicit v1 scope boundary.
**Tournament timing:** Evergreen.

---

## Sprint 39 — Rankings Phase 1 Implementation
**Category:** Genuinely new feature (data sourcing + build) · **Status:** Not started, blocked on Sprint 38

**Goal:** Implement the ranking system per Sprint 38's agreed design, Phase 1 scope.

**Complexity:** Likely high — real manual data-sourcing effort was always the expensive part of this feature (original spec estimated ~60 min for just the Media component across ~1,250 players; a fuller multi-category design costs more). Treat as its own multi-session initiative, not a single bounded sprint.
**Completion criteria:** defined in Sprint 38's design doc, per category/entity.
**Tournament timing:** Design is evergreen; a "current form" category (if included) benefits from being computed against complete tournament data.

---

## Sprint 40 — Documentation & Process Debt Cleanup
**Category:** Documentation + minor technical debt · **Status:** Not started

**Goal:** Bring `docs/08_PROJECT_STATUS_REVIEW.md` back in line with reality; remove misleading tooling signals.

**Scope:**
- Refresh `docs/08_PROJECT_STATUS_REVIEW.md` (best after 33/34/35/36 land).
- Decide (user's call, not yet decided): keep or remove that doc's stated precedence over this document/`SESSION_HANDOFF.md`.
- Decide (user's call, not yet decided): delete the three confirmed-dead stub scripts (`scripts/generate-player-bios.js`, `scripts/lib/bio-templates.js`, `scripts/update-standings.js`)?
- Decide (user's call, not yet decided): delete `netlify/functions/sync-tournament.mjs` outright, or just remove its `netlify.toml` schedule block and keep the file as reference?
- Fix or remove the two no-op steps (`generate-bios`, `generate-rankings`) from the `pre-deploy` npm script chain.

**Dependencies:** Best after 33/34/35/36. **Complexity:** Low.
**Tournament timing:** Evergreen, best done last among whichever sprints run first.

## Sprint 41 — Remaining Photo Gaps (optional, explicitly the user's call)
**Category:** Operational/data-maintenance, evergreen · **Status:** Not started, not yet greenlit

**Goal:** Another recovery pass for 300 remaining null player photos + 3 manager photos (Haiti, Cape Verde, Saudi Arabia).
**Scope:** `node scripts/gather-photos.js` with `RETRY_NULLS=true`, then `WIKIDATA_PASS=true` (same pattern as Sprint 20-21).
**Completion criteria:** coverage improves measurably from 76.9% (996/1,296).
**Tournament timing:** Evergreen, no urgency. Not yet approved to run — ask before starting.

## Sprint 42 — Knockout Bracket Architecture Fixes
**Category:** Architectural bug fix (rendering + data-pipeline consolidation) · **Status:** Investigation complete (2026-07-06), plan below, **not yet implemented**

**Goal:** Fix two confirmed architectural defects in the knockout bracket — a round-level "confirmed" gate that should be per-match, and a bracket connector-line algorithm that positions cards by array order instead of actual propagation relationships — without a visual redesign.

### Background — how this was found

Triggered by a user report of the bracket showing wrong-looking results (paraphrased as "France beat Sweden but Brazil appeared in the downstream slot"). A full read-only investigation (see conversation history, 2026-07-06) traced `js/modules/knockout-bracket.js`, `scripts/update-knockout.js`, `scripts/sync-data.mjs`, and `netlify/functions/live-data.mjs` against the live `data/knockout.json`, and found **two confirmed, independent defects** — neither of which was the original literal example (which didn't reproduce from the data at the time), but both real and evidenced. A Sprint 34 Pass 2 data-maintenance run (see above) then live-confirmed both diagnoses against real, current tournament data before any code changed.

### Defect 1 — round-level "confirmed" tick gate (should be per-match)

**Current behavior** (`js/modules/knockout-bracket.js:73-95, 142-161`): `#buildRound()` computes `allTeamsSet = round.matches.every(m => m.homeTeamId && m.awayTeamId)` — once per round — and passes it to every match in that round as `hideUnplayedTick`. The green `.bracket-team--confirmed` tick is suppressed only when **every** match in the round is fully resolved.

**Why this is wrong:** a round doesn't resolve all-at-once — R32 does (roughly, since it's gated by group-stage completion), but R16/QF/SF each fill in match-by-match over several real days as individual feeder matches conclude. Any single still-unresolved match in a round keeps the tick showing on every other match in that round, including ones resolved days earlier. **Live-confirmed in Pass 2:** with R16 now 8/8 resolved, the round shows its "All confirmed" banner and zero ticks (correct); with QF now 2/4 resolved (`qf-m1`, `qf-m3`), the round shows 4 individual ticks and no banner (`qf-m2`/`qf-m4` still TBD) — the exact symptom, now on the next round, as predicted.

**Fix:** compute the "hide tick" decision **per match**, not per round: `const matchFullySet = m.homeTeamId && m.awayTeamId` inside `#buildMatch()`, used in place of the round-wide `hideUnplayedTick` parameter. A team's tick disappears as soon as *its own match* has both sides known — independent of sibling matches in the same round.

**What happens to the round-level "All confirmed" banner:** keep it, but decouple it entirely from the per-match tick decision. It becomes a standalone milestone indicator (shown once literally every match in the round has both teams, same computation as today) with no bearing on individual tick visibility. This avoids the awkward case where every visible slot looks individually "confirmed" via the new per-match rule, yet the banner doesn't show because of a genuinely-still-open sibling match — that's fine and not confusing, since the banner and the ticks are now answering different questions ("is the whole round done" vs. "is this specific matchup known").

### Defect 2 — connector/positioning algorithm uses array order, not the actual propagation graph

**Current behavior** (`js/modules/knockout-bracket.js:294-297`): `#positionBracket()` computes each card's vertical center as `(prev[i*2] + prev[i*2+1]) / 2` — i.e., it assumes round *r*'s card at array index *i* is fed by round *r-1*'s cards at array indices `2i` and `2i+1`. This is never checked against real feeder relationships.

**Verified mismatch** against `scripts/update-knockout.js`'s `PROPAGATION` map: 7 of 8 R16 slots and 2 of 4 QF slots are positioned/connected incorrectly by this assumption (full table in the investigation notes). Only `r16-m4` and `qf-m1`/`qf-m4` align correctly, by coincidence of array order. **Team names inside each card are always correct** (rendered directly from `match.homeTeamId`/`awayTeamId`, unaffected) — it's the **SVG connector line** between columns that draws the wrong "this feeds that" relationship for most slots. This is very likely the real mechanism behind "traced a line from the France/Sweden result and it visually led to Brazil's box" even though the underlying JSON has always been correct.

**Fix:** derive feeder relationships from the actual propagation topology instead of array position. Concretely:
1. Extract `update-knockout.js`'s `PROPAGATION` map into a small, dependency-free shared module — e.g. `js/bracket-topology.js`, following the existing pattern of `js/tournament-state.js` (pure data/logic, no DOM, no fetching, no Node-only APIs) — so it's importable from both browser code and Node scripts without a build step, consistent with this project's zero-build-step architecture.
2. `update-knockout.js` imports `PROPAGATION` from that module instead of defining it inline (single source of truth — currently the map only exists in one place, which is good, but it's Node-only and the renderer has no way to consult it).
3. `#positionBracket()` in `knockout-bracket.js` uses the same topology to find each match's true two feeder match IDs, looks up their DOM elements/centers by match ID (not array index), and computes the midpoint from those — the connector lines then always represent the real relationship, and the layout keeps working correctly regardless of the order matches happen to appear in `knockout.json`.

**No visual redesign implied by this fix** — same columns, same card style, same overall bracket shape. Only the *derivation* of which two cards a connector line joins changes from "array position" to "graph lookup."

### Defect 3 (found investigating Defect 2's blast radius) — duplicated, fragile propagation-matching logic in two data-sync paths

**Found:** `scripts/sync-data.mjs`'s `syncKnockout()` (lines 128-200) and `netlify/functions/live-data.mjs`'s `mergeKnockout()` (lines 101-157) independently re-implement near-identical logic: match an API result to a local slot by team-ID pair, falling back to "exactly one local slot shares this UTC calendar date" when the slot is still TBD. **This fallback is fragile and already misfired live**, twice, during Sprint 34 Pass 2: `r16-m7`/`r16-m8` (same kickoff date) and `qf-m3`/`qf-m4` (same kickoff date) could not be auto-resolved by either script even though their feeder matches were already complete — both required the manual `update-knockout.js --force` step to fill in.

**Recommendation — consolidate, and mostly supersede the date fallback rather than just hardening it:**
- Extract a single shared `mergeKnockoutData(existingKnockout, apiMatches, teamMap)` function (e.g. `scripts/lib/knockout-merge.mjs`) used by both `sync-data.mjs` (Node CLI) and `netlify/functions/live-data.mjs` (Netlify Function) — both already run in Node/ESM, so a shared import needs no new tooling. This directly answers "should they share a canonical implementation": **yes** — maintaining two hand-copies of the same fallback logic is exactly how a fix to one and not the other reintroduces this defect later.
- Once the `js/bracket-topology.js` propagation graph from Defect 2 exists, the shared merge function can use it as a **third, deterministic resolution path**: for any local slot still TBD, check whether the topology says its two feeder matches are already FT in local data — if so, the winners are already knowable *without needing anything from the API's date field at all*. This isn't available for the very first round (R32, fed by group-stage qualification, not by another knockout match) but covers R16 onward entirely, which is exactly where the date-collision fragility lives today.
- **Explicit decision on the date-based fallback (per the plan requirement to not leave this implicit):** keep it, but demote it to a last-resort path used only when neither team-pair matching nor the propagation-graph resolution applies (in practice, this becomes rare — mostly moot once the graph-based path is added for knockout rounds). Do not attempt to "harden" the date comparison itself (e.g. normalizing UTC-vs-local calendar day) as a primary fix — the propagation graph is a strictly better, deterministic source of truth wherever it applies, and investing in a smarter date heuristic would be solving the wrong layer of the problem.

### Explicitly out of scope for this sprint

**Visual/layout redesign.** The underlying bracket *topology* is correct and matches FIFA's real structure (verified: the two Sprint-27-established halves of 8 R32 matches each cleanly feed separate semifinal paths, with no crossover until the Final, and the existing 3rd-place-branch positioning in `#positionBracket()`'s final-round handling is already correct). Nothing found in this investigation motivates a different visual layout — only the connector *derivation logic* needs fixing. Revisit a possible layout modernization only after Defects 1–3 are implemented and verified, as a separate, later decision.

**Regression test coverage** for these fixes belongs naturally in Sprint 37 (Regression-Prevention Test Coverage, already scoped above) — e.g. a test asserting connector-derived pairs match the topology module for a known bracket state, and a test reproducing the exact R16/QF same-date collision scenario against the consolidated merge function.

**Recommended implementation order:** (1) extract `js/bracket-topology.js` and point `update-knockout.js` at it — pure refactor, no behavior change, easiest to verify in isolation; (2) fix the per-match tick rule (Defect 1) — small, independent, low-risk; (3) fix connector derivation (Defect 2) using the new topology module; (4) consolidate `sync-data.mjs`/`live-data.mjs` into a shared merge function and add the graph-based resolution path (Defect 3) — largest change, do last once 1-3 are settled and verified.

**Dependencies:** None blocking — can start independently of Sprint 37, though sequencing test coverage alongside these fixes (rather than after) would let the tests double as the verification evidence.
**Complexity:** Medium — three related but separable fixes, each individually small; the consolidation in Defect 3 is the largest single piece.
**Completion criteria:** Per-match tick verified correct on a round with mixed resolved/TBD slots; connector lines verified to match the topology graph for every current bracket slot; `sync-data.mjs` and `live-data.mjs` share one merge implementation; a reproduction of the exact R16-same-date collision scenario resolves correctly without manual `update-knockout.js` intervention.
**Tournament timing:** Time-sensitive in the sense that every future round transition (QF→SF, SF→Final) will keep re-exposing Defect 1 and re-testing Defect 3's fallback until fixed — the sooner this lands, the fewer more manual `update-knockout.js` catch-up passes are needed for the same reason.

## Decisions still needed from the user (not yet resolved)

1. Sprint 38 scheduling — dedicated design session vs. inline draft.
2. Sprint 36 scope — all-time vs. WC-only vs. both for `headToHeadStats`.
3. Sprint 40 — three small confirmations: delete dead stub scripts? keep/remove doc precedence claim? delete `sync-tournament.mjs` outright or keep as reference?
4. Sprint 37 tooling — `node:test` (default) vs. Vitest/Jest.
5. Sprint 41 — greenlight, defer, or skip.
6. Sprint 42 — greenlight implementation (plan is written, nothing implemented yet); confirm recommended order (topology module → per-match tick → connector fix → sync/live-data consolidation) before starting.
